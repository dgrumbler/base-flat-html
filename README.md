# base-flat-html
A simple HTML5 flat base theme. Comes with SASS and gulp pre added. 
## Requirements
You can use as is and setup / use your own compiler for the SASS files e.g. Koala.
If you want to use gulp to compile you will need to have npm and node.js installed.
## Installation
If you want to use gulp to compile run the following in your terminal:
```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install
```
Once it's installed all you need to do to automatically compile the SASS files as you make changes is to run:
```bash
$ gulp watch
```
