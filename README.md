# base-flat-html
A simple HTML5 flat base theme. Comes with SASS and gulp pre added. 
## Requirements
You can use as is and setup / use your own compiler for the SASS files e.g. [Koala](http://koala-app.com/).
If you want to use gulp to compile you will need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
## Installation
If you want to use gulp to compile run the following in your terminal:
```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install
```
## AutoCompile SASS using Gulp
Once it's installed all you need to do to automatically compile the SASS files as you make changes is to run:
```bash
$ gulp watch
```
## AutoMinify JavaScript using Gulp
Once gulp is installed all you need to do to automatically compress and minify the scripts.js file as you make changes is to run:
```bash
$ gulp watch
```
If you've already run it for the SASS you don't need to run it again.
